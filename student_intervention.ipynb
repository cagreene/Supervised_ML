In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "The three supervised learning models that I have chosen for this problem are Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Ensemble Methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For decision trees one real-world application would be a financial institution trying to predict whether or not a customer would default on a loan they have given out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of the Decision trees are that they are easy to understand and interpret from being able to visualize the tress. Also, the data requires little data preparation where data doesnâ€™t necessarily need to be normalized or have dummy variables created. But some of its weaknesses are it can create over-complex tress that do not generalize the data well and create biased tress if certain classes dominate the training data set. Decision tress also can be sensitive to small variations in the data which could result in different tress being produced from different iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall this model is a good candidate for this problem because it can naturally overlook non important features, given that there is a relatively large number of features. This allows the most important features to be found easily, which would be very help in this type of problem of trying to predict which students will fail. In the real life a decision maker can focus on a certain number of key indicators to help prevent students from failing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For Support Vector Machine one real-world application would be diagnosing whether a patient has breast cancer or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of support vector machines are they can be effective in a data set that has a high number of features,and  versatile in allowing the modeler use different kernel functions for different applications. Some of the weakness are when the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, poor performance can occur. When the data set is nosiey from overlapping classes and prone to over fit in large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall this model is a good candidate because the dataset has a relatively large number of features, along with a modest size number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For ensemble methods any of the two models above could be used to address there weakness. One real-world example would whether not an online purchasers is fraudulent or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the strengths of the ensemble methods tend to deal with the weakness of the individual model classifiers such as avoiding overfitting, avoiding bias, determining global optimality. But some of itâ€™s weakness is increased use of memory/storage, increased in runtime and decreased interpretability of the results.\n",

    "The single  model that I chose was the support vector machine (SVM). It had the best overall performance considering training time, prediction time and accuracy. Its best model run had a accuracy of 82.28% with a total runtime of 0.0100 seconds. This in comparison to the second best model run that had an accuracy of 76.12% and a runtime of 0.0000 seconds. Considering accuracy is of high importance with only and increase of  0.0100 seconds of run time there is an improvement of 6 percent points. Additionally, the SVM had its best run with the smallest set of data (100 data points), which can be adventageous if for some reason there is limited available data.\n"

    "In general how support vector machines (SVM) work are by finding the best line of separation between a different types of groups. For example plot of green data points and red data points with each point representing a student that either has GPA of 2.8 and above (green point) or has a GPA that is below a 2.8 (red point). And location of these points corresponds to # of missed homework assignments and # of classes missed.  Now with using a SVM, it will fine a line that separates both student types as best as possible with greatest space between the green points and the red points (See image below).That space is called the margin. Additionally, having the space between the closest green points to the line and the closets red points to line equal. So from looking at the image below we say that if student that has a combination of # of missing HWs and # of classes missed that puts their respective dot on the right side of the line then predict that that student will have below a 2.8 GPA.\n",

    "![SVM - Student Missing HW vs Missing Class](SVM_Margin.png)\n",
    "Now if wanted to take this example to the next level and wanted to see if number classes affected students grades, we can still use SVM, but instead of a line a hyperplane(i.e border or wall) would be used to separate the different student groups like shown below.\n",
    "![SVM - Student Missing HW vs Missing Class vs](3d_hyperplane_edited.png)\n",
    "Now to actually apply SVM to a data set it first has learn the relationships and patterns between the blue points and red points. It is usually done is taking a portion of the data set and running the model on that portion to learn those patterns and relations. Then to see how good the model learned, the remaining portion of the data is used to test the model on data that it has never seen before.\n"

There really wasn't much improvement with the tuning of the model and actually there is a loss of 0.4% from the best non tuned SVM run. The justification of this is that the feature space seems to be relatively linear where any added complexity to the original  odel would only decrease the model's accuracy."
